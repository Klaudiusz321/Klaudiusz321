## 🚀 What I'm Currently Working On

- ⚛️ **iTensor Project**: A tensor calculator app built with React + TypeScript frontend and Django backend. It computes Einstein and Weyl tensors from user-defined metrics and is tailored to scientists and students.
- 🌌 **Curvature Calculator** *(Full-Stack)*: A general relativity web tool combining frontend design and backend physics simulation, focused on accurate curvature and spacetime computations.
- 🤖 **Neural Network Facial Recognition**: A home security tool using a neural network (built from scratch in NumPy) to detect and recognize faces.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

**Languages**: Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, C, SQL  
**Frameworks & Libraries**: React, Django, Node.js  
**Databases**: PostgreSQL  
**AI/ML**: Neural Networks (custom), TensorFlow (basics)  
**Physics & Math**: General Relativity, Tensor Calculations, Symbolic & Numerical Methods
