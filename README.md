# 👋 Klaudiusz Sroka

I'm a scientific software developer with a degree in Technical Physics. I build symbolic engines, backend systems, and simulations focused on general relativity, tensor calculus, and physical computing. My work bridges physics, open-source development, and backend engineering.

## 🧠 Projects

### 🔷 iTensor
**Symbolic and numerical computation platform** for general relativity. Computes Christoffel symbols, Ricci, Einstein, and Weyl tensors from user-defined metrics. Full-stack architecture with React + Django.  
→ [https://itensor.online](https://itensor.online)  
→ [Documentation](https://itensor-docs.com)

### 📦 iTensorPy
**Python package** for symbolic tensor computation using SymPy. Supports metric definitions, curvature tensors, differential operations (gradient, divergence, Laplacian), and MHD tools.  
→ [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/itensorpy/)  
→ [Source](https://github.com/Klaudiusz321/itensorpy)

### 🕳️ Raytracing Engine in C
**Real-time black hole simulation engine** written in C. Simulates geodesic motion, light deflection, and relativistic effects in curved spacetime using ray tracing.
