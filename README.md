👋 Hi, I'm Klaudiusz!

I'm a software developer and AI enthusiast passionate about creating innovative solutions at the intersection of physics, software engineering, and artificial intelligence.

🚀 What I'm Currently Working On:
⚛️ iTensor Project: A tensor calculator app developed with React + TypeScript frontend and Django backend, optimized for SEO and tailored to scientists and students.
🌌 Full-Stack Curvature Calculator: A web-based tool rooted in general relativity theory, integrating my skills in React, TypeScript, Django, and advanced physics computations.
🤖 Neural Network Facial Recognition: Training a custom-built neural network from scratch in Python to recognize faces, aimed at practical home security implementations.

# iTensor

> A symbolic tensor calculator for general relativity — built from scratch.

iTensor is a scientific tool that computes Christoffel symbols, Ricci, Einstein, and Weyl tensors from user-defined spacetime metrics. Designed for physicists, students, and developers working with differential geometry and general relativity.

This is the backend engine powering [iTensor.online](https://itensor.online), an open tool built as part of my engineering thesis and continued as a solo project.
